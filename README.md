# microservice-template-golang-mongodb

### Before running this project, please run this first:
```bash
go mod tidy
```

<b>Notes:</b> This boilerplate is using go-chi as the router and MongoDB as its main DB connection.
And don't forget to utilize Makefile (there are already commands to run the server locally and also to generate the swagger documentation).
